            <p id="subDesc1">
                I've always enjoyed the idea of being able to understand how computers worked <br>
                this curious mindset led me to start dabbling with programming very early on, starting off <br>
                with Python and the eventual attempts to learn C (That didn't go well ðŸ˜’) all the way <br>
                to game engines like Unity and Godot. <br>
            </p>
            <p id="subDesc2">
                After getting to opportunity to focus my enthusiasm in college i decided to <br>
                use my free time to get ahead of schedule and teach myself web development and it's <br>
                underlying technologies (and how they intersect with my major).
            </p>
            <p id="subDesc3">
                Altough this is all rather recent to me i pride myself in beign a quick learner <br>
                and always striving to be the best i can be. <br>
                Other than this website i have a couple of projects uploaded to my <a href="https://github.com/Mechaspirit1">Github</a> <br>
                and i would be very happy to hear your opinions on it !

                I am currently on the second term of my cybersecurity program at the <br>
                <a href="https://fatecjd.edu.br/site/">Faculdade de Tecnologia de JundiaÃ­</a>, and altough merely a begginer,<br>
                the environment and athmosphere offered by the academic world <br> 
                drives me to learn as much as i can even on my spare time.
            </p>
            <p id="subDesc5">
                These are some of the skills i have been honing: <br>
                <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5, Javascript, Node/NPM, Python, Git, Linux. </b><br>
                This website, for example is built entirely on vanilla HTML, CSS <br>
                and JS and being updated constantly through the use of Git !
            </p>
            <p id="subDesc6">
                As for what i intend on learning in the future, i am quite interested <br>
                in learning Tailwind, Backend technologies and a third language.

                I am currently looking for internship opportunities that allow me to grow <br>
                both as a developer and a professional in general. I am interested in all <br>
                fields of IT but opportunities to work in either Web Development or <br>
                cybersecurity would be deeply apreciated !
