            <p id="subDesc1">
                I've always enjoyed the idea of being able to understand how computers worked 
                this curious mindset led me to start dabbling with programming very early on, starting off 
                with Python and the eventual attempts to learn C (That didn't go well ðŸ˜’) all the way 
                to game engines like Unity and Godot. 
            </p>
            <p id="subDesc2">
                After getting to opportunity to focus my enthusiasm in college i decided to 
                use my free time to get ahead of schedule and teach myself web development and it's 
                underlying technologies (and how they intersect with my major).
            </p>
            <p id="subDesc3">
                Altough this is all rather recent to me i pride myself in beign a quick learner 
                and always striving to be the best i can be. 
                Other than this website i have a couple of projects uploaded to my <a href="https://github.com/Mechaspirit1" target="_blank">Github</a>
                and i would be very happy to hear your opinions on it !

                I am currently on the second term of my cybersecurity program at the 
                <a href="https://fatecjd.edu.br/site/" target="_blank">Faculdade de Tecnologia de JundiaÃ­</a>, and altough merely a begginer,
                the environment and athmosphere offered by the academic world
                drives me to learn as much as i can even on my spare time.
            </p>
            <p id="subDesc5">
                These are some of the skills i have been honing: 
                <b>HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5, Javascript, Node/NPM, Python, Git, Linux. </b>
                This website, for example is built entirely on vanilla HTML, CSS
                and JS and being updated constantly through the use of Git !
            </p>
            <p id="subDesc6">
                As for what i intend on learning in the future, i am quite interested
                in learning Tailwind, Backend technologies and a third language.

                I am currently looking for internship opportunities that allow me to grow 
                both as a developer and a professional in general. I am interested in all 
                fields of IT but opportunities to work in either Web Development or
                cybersecurity would be deeply apreciated !
